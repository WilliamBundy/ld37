This is the code I'll be starting out LD37 with

It uses a lot of code from my other project, Rituals, but largely tweaked.

Currently relies on:
	- SDL2
	- miniz
	- stb_image
	- stb_vorbis
	- sts_mixer
	- dr_wav
	- glad (gl loader)

I might end up using
	- SDL_Mixer
	- dr_flac
	- any number of other free and open source libraries.

Asset-wise, the current music and graphics are just stuff I have lying around 
from other projects, and won't be used in the final game. 

The current font is gohufont-14, but I might use a different one for the 
final game. 

You are free to use this code under the terms of the MIT license
I might public domain/unlicense/wtfpl this later, but for now, MIT will do.
